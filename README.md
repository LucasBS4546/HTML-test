# HTML-test
Just a silly test on HTML i'm doing. In time it will be improved, but nothing of notice to be seen here.
Also, the text is in Portuguese, but I plan to make an english version when I learn more HTML.

Another thing to be noted is that the HTML code needs a folder with the src images for them to load properly. They will be provided here as well.
